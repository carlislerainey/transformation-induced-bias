This repository contains the manuscript and code for the early working paper "Transformation-Induced Bias: Unbiased Coefficients Do Not Imply Unbiased Quantities of Interest." 

You can find the latest version [here](doc/bias.pdf).

Here's a working abstract:

> Political scientists commonly focus on quantities of interest computed from model coefficients rather than on the coefficients themselves. However, the quantities of interest, such as predicted probabilities, first differences, and marginal effects, do not inherit the small sample properties of the coefficient estimates. Indeed, unbiased coefficients estimates are neither necessary nor sufficient for unbiased estimates of the quantities of interest. I characterize this transformation-induced bias, provide an approximation, illustrate its significance with two hypothetical examples, and highlight its importance to methodological research.
